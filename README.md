# Film Feedback AI

    Film Feedback AI is a sentiment analysis project designed to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) methods to analyze the text of movie reviews and determine the sentiment expressed by the reviewer.

    ## Motivation
    This project aims to help users quickly gauge the sentiment of movie reviews, allowing for more informed decisions when choosing films to watch. It adds value to movie enthusiasts, filmmakers, and marketers by providing insights into audience perceptions.

    ## Installation Instructions
    To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary packages. You'll need Python 3.x and pip installed on your machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/azizharouna/Film-Feedback-AI.git
    cd Film-Feedback-AI
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ## Usage
    1. Load the dataset using the provided data loading scripts.
    2. Preprocess the movie reviews for analysis (cleaning, tokenization, etc.).
    3. Train the sentiment analysis model.
    4. Evaluate the model's performance.
    5. Use the model to make predictions on new reviews.

    ## Dataset
    This project utilizes the [IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) for training and evaluation.
